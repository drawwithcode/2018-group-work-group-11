# Project idea:
* The idea behind this project is to use simple and intuitive interactions to help everyone understand the scientific processes behind the well-known phenomenon of the Northern Lights. Through simple and intuitive interactions, the goal is to show the visual effects related to the different processes.
* There are three kinds of interactions through which the user can manipulate the view of the aurora. The first one affects the light intensity through the solar wind and its speed: the user blows on the microphone to increase the wind. The particles acceleration can be increased by dragging a circle, and higher acceleration causes the aurora to alter its shape. The last interaction allows the user to connect a colourful object to the kind of element which generates streaks of that same color: this can be observed by showing the object to the camera.


# Design Challenges:
Designing the structure of the experience, it was hard to come up with interactions that would immediately remind of the physical process. In the end we thought of three interactions that would visually and manually correspond to the effect on the aurora.

# Code challenges:
* It has been challenging controling the camera as an aside sketch and making the camera recognize the colors, we tried using a library but then we managed to solve our problem in a easier way.
* Using normal p5 one of the hardest challenges was to set the parameters for the camera color recognition. Since we wanted the camera to only recognize actual red, green and blue, it becomes difficult for it to recognize the color because of the variations of light in the room.
* We also had problems finding the proper browser for our projects, because Chrome and Firefow had problems working with the camera color recognition. In the end we solved the problems with the browser Opera.

# Inspirations/References
We were inspired by websites like this one, where we saw how simple games can help everyone, kids and adults, understand science experiencing it on their own screen. We decided to use a simple style and design so that the focus would be on the visual effects of the scientific processes.
