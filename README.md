Project idea
The idea behind this project is to use simple and intuitive interactions to help everyone understand the scientific processes behind the well-known phenomenon of the Northern Lights. Through simple and intuitive interactions, the goal is to show the visual effects related to the different processes.
There are three kinds of interactions through which the user can manipulate the view of the aurora. The first one affects the light intensity through the solar wind and its speed: the user blows on the microphone to increase the wind. The particles acceleration can be increased by dragging a circle, and higher acceleration causes the aurora to alter its shape. The last interaction allows the user to connect a colourful object to the kind of element which generates streaks of that same color: this can be observed by showing the object to the camera.

Design challenges
The interactions were thought in order to combine the northern lights visual effects and their physical process, it has been challenging creating easy and undertsandable interactions 

Code challenges
It has been challenging controling the camera as an aside sketch and making the camera recognize the colors, we tried using a library but then we managed to solve our problem in a easier way.
