NORTHERN LIGHTS
This is an interactive experience meant to spread knowledge about the scientific processes behind the known phenomenon of the Northern Lights.
It is meant to be viewed on computer and it includes a homepage, a tutorial and the actual interactive game. Each interaction is thought to recall the corresponding scientific process.
There are three kinds of interactions through which the user can manipulate the view of the aurora. The first one affects the light intensity through the solar wind and its speed: the user blows on the microphone to increase the wind. The particles acceleration can be increased by dragging a circle, and higher acceleration causes the aurora to alter its shape. The last interaction allows the user to connect a colourful object to the kind of element which generates streaks of that same color: this can be observed by showing the object to the camera.
